# Endangered-Crossing
Educational Game

Abstract

Endangered Crossing is an engaging educational game; as it works towards informing the young population regarding the trafficking of endangered animals. In the game, the user simulates the life of an endangered animal (of their choosing), as they attempt to avoid traffickers and other obstacles, using the arrow keys. As the game progresses, depending on the userâ€™s course of action, interactive pop-ups will educate them about the abuse, fun facts, and reasons for the endangerment of animals.
